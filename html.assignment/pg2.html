		<p> Believe it or not some people don't end up finishing High School. Everyone has their own reason too not being able to finish high School. But there is a huge trend going around where kids don't even finish High School anymore simply due to them just not wanting to attend class anymore. There is also an option of going to night school and graduating like that or even at least get ur GED but even then a lot of kids don't even want to get that done and them not knowing that simply having a High School Diploma can take you a long way. During this time period a lot of things have been changing and it has been impacting a lot of students and not finishing High School.
